          As a product designer at <a href="https://dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, I built innovative experiences that pushed the bounds of desktop collaboration. I received a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180052587A1/en?oq=15%2f339729" target="_blank">patent</a> for technology I invented and won a coveted Hack Week award. I also designed key integrations for leading partners including Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook.
